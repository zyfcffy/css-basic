        <h2>Simply charging a phone is an even bigger hurdle. There's help, but the need is greater.</h2>
        <p>It's always hard for Franz Lupo to keep his phone charged, and he's using some of that juice to talk with me. From a San Francisco Bay Area town where he lives in a tent, Lupo tells me over the phone that he typically goes to Starbucks or the local library to restore his battery to full bars. </p>
